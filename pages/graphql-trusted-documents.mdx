# GraphQL Trusted Documents

[GraphQLConf 2023](https://graphql.org/conf/) was an absolute delight! I
finally met many of the people that I've worked with at the GraphQL Working
Group over the past few years, and they're even nicer in person! And the
attendees were delightful; it was really interesting hearing about how they use
GraphQL.

My biggest takeaway from the first day of the conference was that almost
everyone should be protecting their GraphQL endpoints with an allowlist, but almost
no-one is!

## Who should be using a GraphQL allowlist?

Anyone who

1. exposes their GraphQL endpoint to the internet, and
2. doesn't intend their GraphQL API to be consumed by third parties.

This is anyone who is using GraphQL to power their own websites, mobile apps and
desktop apps but isn't deliberately exposing their API for others to use. Those
of you who this applies to (and that is the vast majority of GraphQL users!)
should be using an allowlist so that only GraphQL operations that your own
developers write can be executed against your GraphQL schema.

Adopting a GraphQL allowlist significantly decreases the attack surface of your
GraphQL API since only operations that your developers have written can be
executed. This technique has been used within Facebook since before GraphQL was
open sourced, it's very much a best practice if you meet the criteria above!

## Why isn't everyone using GraphQL allowlists already?

Many haven't heard of the technique. Of those who have, many knew that they
should be doing it, but failed to find resources on the "how," or expected it to
be a lot of work. Another issue was people confusing the allowlist technique
known as "persisted queries" (aka "stored operations", "persisted documents",
and various other names) for the bandwidth-saving technique "automatic persisted
queries (APQ)".

Worst of all, people felt that they were already protecting their endpoints by
disabling query introspection, when in reality there are so many ways for an
attacker to work around that: extracting hints from error messages, sniffing
network traffic, and fuzzing field names to name just a few. At best, disabling
introspection gives you security-through-obscurity.

In my opinion, if you're disabling introspection then you're doing it wrong;
you should instead be using an operation allowlist such as "trusted documents" to prevent untrusted operations
from running against your API.


## What is a trusted document?

In GraphQL, an _executable document_ is a text string that consists of one or
more query, mutation or subscription operations and their associated fragments
using the GraphQL language. People commonly refer to them as "queries", but that
term is a little ambiguous —
["executable document"](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#ExecutableDocument) is
the precise term.

A _trusted document_ is an executable document, identified via a unique
identifier (typically a hash), that you've told the server to trust. In most
cases, a trusted document would be written by the developers of your web, mobile
and/or desktop apps.

<Pullquote>

a **trusted document** is any GraphQL document the server can trust, typically because it was **written by your developers**

</Pullquote>


Yes, "trusted document" is _yet another_ name for persisted queries/persisted
operations/stored operations. But this time, the critical part (that it's
_trusted_!) is in the name. It's much more obvious what a "trusted document"
means, and no risk of confusing it with "automatic persisted queries". I hope
that the entire GraphQL ecosystem can move towards using the term "trusted
document" when referring to this concept.

On top of the new naming, I recently wrote up
[a specification for Persisted Documents](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/264/files?short_path=9be5577#diff-9be5577e05ae2112d2b8f95584b162d0dec01453bf6c85df58bf5db4f2c9727a)
which can be used to implement trusted documents (or automatic persisted
queries).



## How do I add trusted documents to my stack?

If you already use code generation with your GraphQL clients (e.g. for type
safety) then it's relatively easy. When you build your application:

1. Have the code generator write out the document(s) that your client is using,
2. Generate a hash for each of these documents using SHA256, and
3. Have your server store into a trusted key-value store the GraphQL document as
   the value and the SHA256 hash as the key.

When the client issues a request to the GraphQL endpoint, it should replace the
`query` parameter with a `documentId` parameter which is `sha256:` followed by
the SHA256 hash of your document.

When the server receives a request, it should look for this `documentId`. If
there is no `documentId` in the request, it should raise an exception\* and stop
processing the request. Otherwise, it should look up the GraphQL document for
this `documentId` in the key-value store, and continue executing the request as
if this were the `query` the client submitted all along.

\* _If you're doing this for existing GraphQL APIs then you may wish to capture
the hashes of all documents in use for the next month or so, and explicitly
allow these through to avoid breaking existing clients._

<Pullquote>

**clients send hash to server, server finds associated document** and continues
as normal

</Pullquote>


That's really all there is to it. Choosing what to use as a key-value store is
entirely up to you; but here's a couple of ideas:

- If you have a monorepo for your server and client(s), you could store the
  operations as `.trusted_documents/<hash>.graphql` into the git repository;
  this will even help you know when and why the given document was generated.
- Otherwise, maybe from CI, your client build process should issue the queries
  that are needed (and their hashes) to an authenticated endpoint on the server.
  The server should then store these wherever it finds convenient: a database, a
  persistent key-value store service (e.g. Redis), or maybe an external service
  like DynoDB or S3.


## Do trusted documents have more benefits?

Besides security, you mean? Well, as it happens, yes!

<Pullquote>

**security**, **bandwidth**, **caching**, and **schema evolution**

</Pullquote>

Trusted documents can help reduce network bandwidth because you don't need to
send the (rather long, at times) GraphQL documents from the client to the server
each time — just a short hash instead.

If you set your server up such that it accepts GraphQL queries (but NOT
mutations!) via GET requests, you can easily make your queries HTTP cacheable:
use a dedicated URL for each trusted document/operationName combo (e.g.
`https://example.com/graphql/<hash>/<operationName>`) and set the relevant
caching headers (don't forget to use `Vary` if you have your client send
variables via headers!) and voila! You could even combine this with a content
delivery network to get caching on the edge; though this is quite coarse
whole-response caching. (For a more powerful take on GraphQL caching at the
edge, check out [my sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/benjie) Stellate's
[partial query caching](https://stellate.co/blog/partial-query-caching) — it
looks fantastic!)

One huge benefit of trusted documents that's not talked about enough is that
they give you a great insight into exactly which fields are used, and by which
clients. Want to remove a field from your GraphQL API, but you're not sure it's
safe to do so? Simply remove it and then validate all of your trusted documents
against the new GraphQL API — if the validations pass then you know it's safe to
remove.


## Are trusted documents a silver bullet?

It might seem at first that with persisted operations there's no need for the
server to:

- disable introspection
- apply depth limits
- apply pagination limits
- perform query cost analysis

And you're right; those needs are significantly diminished! But you still need
to be careful about the queries you write. Though an attacker can no longer
issue arbitrary queries against your GraphQL API, they can still take the
queries you already have and issue them with their own carefully crafted inputs.

<Pullquote>

you still need to **be careful** about the queries you write

</Pullquote>


Each of the above concerns still exists, but now it applies to just the trusted
documents that your developers are writing, rather than runtime checks against
arbitrary operations your server is receiving. You should check your documents
before you persist them to ensure that they meet your requirements for safety;
this is a one-time cost per document rather than a cost incurred for every
request as before.

You should also train your developers on the writing of "safe" operations.
Imagine you trusted a document such as:

```graphql
query TopUsers($limit: Int! = 10) {
  topUsers(first: $limit) {
    id
    name
    avatar
  }
}
```

An attacker could issue this query with a `$limit` of `2147483647` and now your
server is on the hook to return up to 2 billion results. Teaching your
developers to hardcode pagination limits into the query itself is one solution
to this, another is to maintain limits in the server and throw out requests that
clearly exceed sensible bounds.

Similarly if you have large input object trees (for example "filter" objects)
then it's best to specify as much as you can into the query itself, and make the
variables only for the "leaves" - this way an attacker can't make a punishingly
complex filter for your server to execute.

## Share the news of trusted documents today!

"Persisted queries" has been an imprecise technique that is widely adopted; on
the client side Relay
[has a specification for their Persisted Queries](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/persisted-queries/),
and Apollo also
[has their own](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/persisted-queries/).
The Guild (another of the companies
[sponsoring my open source work](https://github.com/sponsors/benjie)) also
[specifies persisted operations for GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/persisted-operations)
and Valu Digital have
[a plugin for GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/valu-digital/graphql-codegen-persisted-query-ids)
to generate the persisted query IDs for you.

With the introduction of a vendor agnostic GraphQL Foundation-hosted
specification for persisted documents as part of the GraphQL-over-HTTP project,
I aim to work with the maintainers of these projects to maximize compatibility and ease adoption
of trusted documents across the entire ecosystem.
