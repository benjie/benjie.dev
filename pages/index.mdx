# Hi; I'm Benjie!

I'm a [community funded](https://github.com/sponsors/benjie) open-source
developer, working in the intersections of GraphQL, Node.js and PostgreSQL.

I'm also a member of [the GraphQL Technical Steering
Committee](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#tsc-members),
a [significant contributor to the GraphQL
spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/graphs/contributors), and am very
active in [the GraphQL working group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/graphs/contributors) community.

Looking to contribute to the GraphQL specification, but need some guidance?
Reach out to me via [the GraphQL Discord](https://discord.graphql.org) in the
`#graphql-spec` channel — I'm @Benjie — and I'll help however I can.

## Maintainer

Some of the open source projects I maintain:

- [Gra*fast*](https://grafast.org) - a cutting-edge planning and execution engine for GraphQL
- [PostGraphile](https://postgraphile.org) - an unopinionated tool to speed up development of extremely high performance GraphQL APIs backed primarily by a PostgreSQL database
- [Graphile Worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker) - a high-performance Postgres-backed job queue
- [Graphile Migrate](https://github.com/graphile/migrate) - a highly opinionated forward-only migration framework for PostgreSQL
- [Graphile Starter](https://github.com/graphile/starter) - a highly opinionated SaaS starter backed by the Graphile suite
