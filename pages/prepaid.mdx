# Schedule a prepaid call

#### If you have not prepaid, please either contact Jem or [use the regular booking interface](/book).

You will have received a "code" to enter as part of your contract; if
you cannot find it please email Jem. Please use the calendar
[below](#book) to pick a mutually
convenient slot for us to talk. To get the most out of our call, please
prepare a list of discussion points/questions beforehand (do not send
them), make sure you have a development environment set up you can use
to demonstrate any issues, and make sure your code is committed so that
edits can be easily tracked.

Calls are held on Zoom; you will be emailed an invitation soon after
booking (please get in touch via team at graphile dot com if you don't
receive it within 30 minutes). You may invite up to 9 of your colleagues
to join you on the call, and you may record the Zoom session (but we
accept no responsibility if the recording does not work). Since this is
an ad-hoc conversation with no preparation or review process, neither
Benjie nor Graphile Ltd. can accept any responsibility or liability for
actions taken during or as a result of the call. Any information or code
received should be validated and evaluated critically before being acted
upon/used.
