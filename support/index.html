        This page is for companies that have a support contract with Graphile
        Ltd; if you don't have a support contract please either contact Jem or
        <a href="/" class="underline">use the regular booking interface</a>.
      </h2>

      <p>
        You will have received a "code" to enter as part of your support
        contract; if you cannot find it please email Jem. Please use the
        calendar below to pick a mutually convenient slot for us to talk. To get
        the most out of our call, please prepare a list of discussion
        points/questions beforehand (do not send them), make sure you have a
        development environment set up you can use to demonstrate any issues,
        and make sure your code is committed so that edits can be easily
        tracked.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
        Calls are held on Zoom; you will be emailed an invitation soon after
        booking (please get in touch via team at graphile dot com if you don't
        receive it within 30 minutes). You may invite up to 9 of your colleagues
        to join you on the call, and you may record the Zoom session (but we
        accept no responsibility if the recording does not work). Since this is
        an ad-hoc conversation with no preparation or review process, neither
        Benjie nor Graphile Ltd. can accept any responsibility or liability for
        actions taken during or as a result of the call. Any information or code
        received should be validated and evaluated critically before being acted
        upon/used.
