      <p>
        You can book an hour of screen sharing
        <a href="#book" class="underline">below</a>. During the call, you can
        ask Benjie question related to your GraphQL, Node.js and/or PostgreSQL
        projects. Benjie will try and help you, and may point you to relevant
        documentation and examples, speak about various practices that can be
        applied, talk about tooling that may help, help you debug problems in
        your code, write small code samples, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get the most out of our call, please prepare a list of discussion
        points/questions beforehand (do not send them), make sure you have a
        development environment set up you can use to demonstrate any issues,
        and make sure your code is committed so that edits can be easily
        tracked.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
        Calls are held on Zoom; you will be emailed an invitation soon after
        booking (please get in touch via team at graphile dot com if you don't
        receive it within 30 minutes). You may invite up to 9 of your colleagues
        to join you on the call, and you may record the Zoom session (but we
        accept no responsibility if the recording does not work). Since this is
        an ad-hoc conversation with no preparation or review process, neither
        Benjie nor Graphile Ltd. can accept any responsibility or liability for
        actions taken during or as a result of the call. Any information or code
        received should be validated and evaluated critically before being acted
        upon/used.
